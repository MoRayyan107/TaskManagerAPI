# 🗂️ Task Manager API

## 📌 Project Description

The **Task Manager API** is a backend service built with **Java + Spring Boot** that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently. This RESTful API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, and uses an in-memory H2 database for quick setup and testing.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand backend development using **Spring Boot**
- Practice **OOP principles** and API design
- Learn CRUD operations with **Spring Data JPA**
- Apply REST principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Create a portfolio-worthy project using Java
